A pressing inquiry among content creators today is whether Google can actually identify if an article is AI-generated. The response is more complex than most SEO experts may acknowledge.

## Current Understanding

Google has intentionally kept its AI detection capabilities ambiguous. In its official communications, the company claims to prioritize content quality over its source. However, recent performance trends in search engine results pages (SERPs) suggest otherwise.

Following the December 2025 core update, websites that depended on mass-produced AI content experienced substantial traffic declines—some plummeting by 80% or more almost instantly. Was this due to Google recognizing the content as AI-generated, or simply because the content lacked quality?

## Detection Versus Quality Indicators

It's crucial to distinguish between these scenarios. Google might be:

- Actively identifying AI-generated content and imposing penalties.
- Recognizing AI-written material but only penalizing those of lower quality.
- Not identifying AI content at all, but enforcing quality standards that AI outputs typically do not meet.
Each of these possibilities necessitates a distinct strategy from content creators. As of now, we lack definitive evidence to clarify which scenario is accurate.

## Analyzing the Evidence

Recent studies have sought to address this issue. An analysis by Ahrefs, which examined 600,000 pages, revealed virtually no link between AI content use and ranking positions. However, this study looked for correlation among existing pages rather than establishing causation in a controlled environment.

What is required is a proper controlled experiment with comparable content across new domains. This is precisely what we are pursuing here at RankNotes.

## Implications for You

Until we acquire more concrete data, a prudent strategy is to utilize AI as a drafting aid rather than a publishing solution. Ensure to significantly edit the output. Inject your expertise and make the content uniquely yours.

The websites that thrived after the December update weren't those steering clear of AI. Instead, they were the ones that employed AI thoughtfully, integrating human oversight and authentic expertise into their work.

## FAQ

### What is Anthrotuning?

**Anthrotuning** refers to the fine-tuning process of adjusting AI content to match natural human communication patterns. This includes varying sentence length, adding imperfect phrasing, removing overly formal transitions, and introducing the subtle inconsistencies that characterize authentic human writing. Well-anthrotuned content passes both algorithmic detection and the human "gut check."
