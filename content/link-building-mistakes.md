Link building remains the most misunderstood part of SEO. After auditing hundreds of sites, here are the mistakes I see killing rankings over and over again.

## Mistake 1: Prioritizing Quantity Over Relevance

A single link from a relevant industry site outweighs dozens of links from random directories. Google's algorithm has gotten remarkably good at understanding topical relationships between sites.

If you run a SaaS company and your backlink profile is full of links from recipe blogs and pet care sites, that signals manipulation, not authority. Focus on sources where your target audience actually spends time.

## Mistake 2: Ignoring Anchor Text Distribution

Natural link profiles have diverse anchor text. When 80% of your backlinks use your exact target keyword as anchor text, it screams manipulation to Google's spam filters.

A healthy anchor text profile looks like this:
- 30-40% branded anchors (your company name)
- 20-30% naked URLs
- 20-30% generic anchors (click here, this article, etc.)
- 10-20% partial match keywords
- Less than 5% exact match keywords

If your profile looks nothing like this, you have a problem.

## Mistake 3: Building Links to the Wrong Pages

Most sites focus all their link building on the homepage or money pages. This leaves the rest of their content orphaned and unable to rank.

The smarter approach is building links to your best informational content, then using internal links to distribute that authority throughout your site. This looks natural and strengthens your entire domain.

## Mistake 4: Neglecting Link Velocity

Links should accumulate gradually over time. A sudden spike of 500 new backlinks in a month followed by nothing for six months looks artificial.

Sustainable link building means consistent effort. A few quality links every week beats a massive campaign once a year. Google tracks velocity patterns, and unnatural spikes trigger scrutiny.

## Mistake 5: Not Monitoring Your Backlink Profile

Links can become toxic over time. Sites that once seemed legitimate can turn into link farms. Competitors can run negative SEO campaigns against you. Without regular monitoring, you will not catch these problems until rankings tank.

Set up monthly backlink audits. Use Google Search Console and third-party tools to spot new links. Disavow anything that looks spammy before it drags your site down.

## The Path Forward

Link building is not dead, but the tactics that worked five years ago will hurt you today. Focus on earning links through genuinely valuable content and strategic outreach. The days of gaming the system are over.
